My dashboards created in RShiny

"Praca_domowa_4_jacemanko.R" is a beta-version of a Shiny dashboard that was part of my student assignment.
It allows for selecting a Star Wars character either by selecting them on a scatter plot or by filtering them using provided filters on species and hair color. Please not that filter automatically update each other, so that it prevents selecting empty rows by choosing a nonexistent combination of species and hair color. However, this functionality still can be improved, as it performs not so smooth as expected. 

Clicking on a row in a datatable triggers an additional field with detailed character description.
